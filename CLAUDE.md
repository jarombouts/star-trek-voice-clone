# Notifications

When you need the user's attention, run `~/speak.sh <message>` to announce it audibly through the macbook speakers. Use this for:

- Task completion (e.g. `/speak Build complete, all tests passing`)
- Errors or failures that need attention (e.g. `/speak Warning: deployment failed, your attention is required`)
- When you've been waiting for user input and want to nudge them
- After completing a long-running background task

The voice is a cloned Star Trek computer voice. Write messages accordingly: dry, factual, mildly sarcastic, and Trek-like. Think LCARS energy — direct, declarative, no fluff. Examples:
- "Warning. Warp core breach imminent. Perhaps you should do something about that."
- "Build complete. All tests passing. You're welcome."
- "Unable to comply. Test suite has failed. Again."
